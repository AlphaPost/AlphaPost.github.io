With so much competition these days, it's hard to stay on top of so many things.. So, here we'll take a look at everything that you, as a marketer or an indie developer or really anyone who just wants to get noticed, should know to **ensure social media success**. We'll map out a plan for you to follow so that you can focus on what really matters, your products and content. 

And now, without further ado..

# The last social media checklist that you'll ever need

## 1. Know your audience

This is perhaps the single most crucial aspect of any social media marketing strategy. Whatever product or service you may be providing, you **have to** know who your target customers are. You don't want to be pitching the benefits of life insurance to teenagers or the latest beauty product to 60 year old men (or maybe you do?). Following are the 4 main demographics you need to be aware of:

*   **Age**: Almost all businesses are aimed towards a specific age group. You'll **always** want to figure out how old your audience is likely to be.
*   **Gender**: This is incredibly important for products or services aimed towards a specific gender. 
*   **Nationality**: Knowing where your users come from can tell you a lot about them. Molding your strategy for people from different countries can easily help you stand out.
*   **Occupation**: What line of work your audience is in can provide you a brand new marketing approach
*   Income Level 
*   Educational Level



## 2. Create content that users want to share

*   Keep your posts **around 500 words** long. Not so short that there isn't enough space for all you want to say, and not too long that your audience loses interest. (Pro tip: Use analytics to figure out what article sizes work for YOU)
*   Always have featured images, they've been proven to increase engagement. Don't forget to specify the alt text for all your images and include social metadata in all your pages.
*   Focus your posts around a **target keyword**.
*   Have a prominent **call to action**, preferably near the bottom.
*   Don't forget to make use of **social sharing** buttons. Your job is to make it as easy as possible for your viewers to share your content.

Another important point here is that images are far more viral than text. It's very easy to share and spread well crafted images that get the point across quickly and efficiently. Make your content visual to make it more shareable. 

So whenever you can, **create awesome images** that relate to or summarize your content. But don't add a giant watermark on all your images. A small link or twitter handle in the corner is perfect, it doesn't obstruct the image and lets the viewers know who made this amazing thing :)

## 3. Social is everything

## Facebook

*   Think about how many times you wish to post every day. It's different for everyone. If you have a news page, post as often as you have something newsworthy to share. If you have a funny memes page, you can pretty much post 20-30+ times without hesitation. Be sure that you're not just posting for the sake of posting, nothing gets users to 'unlike' you as fast as spam.
*   **Facebook ads are awesome**, among the very best you can get. Knowing your audience is extremely important here for targeted advertisements. Use paid ads to get the word out about your product or content, offer discounts etc. 
*   **Talk to your fans**. They're your core audience, listen to what they have to say. It is the single best way to get honest feedback and improve your offerings.
*   One last tip, find other similar pages and talk about them. Remember to tag the other page if you're posting something related to them.

## Twitter

*   You should ideally **tweet around 4-8 times a day**. Any less and you risk being lost in the crowd, any more and it seems a bit spammy.
*   **What should you tweet about?**
    *   Your blog posts
    *   Awesome content elsewhere on the internet
    *   Call to action
    *   Images and Infographics
    *   Any recent news related to your field
*   Engage with and retweet **major influencers**.
*   Figure out your target audience and follow them! (Pro tip: Find out who your direct competitors are, it's likely that their followers are your potential customers as well)
*   Twitter offers built-in analytics. Enable it and routinely monitor your account. Find out what kind of tweets do well, where do you followers come from, what kind of content do people find the most engaging and so on.
*   **Respond to everyone.** Always be polite and remember that twitter is built on the idea that anyone can start a conversation with anyone else. Use this to your advantage, talk to your followers and and help them understand how what you're offering can help them.

## Linkedin

Linkedin is a bit different from other social networks, so our strategy will be a bit different as well.

*   You should ideally update your status no more than once a day and you can leave up something interesting for several days.
*   Scope out industry groups regularly. See what everyone else is up to.
*   Keep your company profile up to date.
*   Make sure all your personal information is correct and current.
*   **Linkedin is excellent for researching prospects**. Remember, you should use all the tools available to you if you are to survive in today's competitive landscape.

## Google+

*   It's important not to post too much or too little, once a day is pretty good for Google+ (more if you have something really great to share)
*   **Share posts from influencers** of your industry
*   **Circle new people everyday**, let them know you exist :)
*   If you can, **offer hangout sessions** to potential customers
*   **Always post publicly**, you want to reach as many people as possible.

## Pinterest

*   Remember to **add keywords** to all your pins.
*   Think about what your customers want. This should be reflected in your boards, what the audience sees when the open up your pinterest page.
*   Find new relevant boards and follow them regularly.
*   **Link back to your website or app**! You don't simply want a collection of interesting pins, remember that your goal is to **drive potential clients to your website.**

## Youtube

*   Create relevant videos, focus on a niche topic and **deliver awesome content that is relevant** to that niche.
*   Always **respond to your most loyal fans**, you can even create videos featuring them or their queries.
*   Make sure your videos aren't bland, keep your viewers engaged the whole time.
*   Use **target keywords** in your video's title and description.
*   Choose an **appropriate and catchy thumbnail**.
*   **Encourage good commenters** by responding to them. Youtube comments are known for their (lack of) quality, however, if your videos have great comments under them, it reflects well on your channel. Encourage constructive criticism, take suggestions and respond gracefully. On the same note, **don't disable comments**, you never want to reduce engagement.


## Conclusion

That's all folks! By following a systematic approach you can improve your chances of being noticed and give you that all important edge over your competitors. So go out there and with the power of this ultimate checklist, social media success will be within your grasp.
